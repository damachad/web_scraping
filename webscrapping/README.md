# Web scarping of wine products' data
This Python program collects price and discount information for specific wines from three different online stores in Portugal: Continente, Garrafeira Soares, and Supermercado El Corte Ingl√©s. 
It scrapes the product data for each wine using the EAN (European Article Number) code, and then saves the information to a CSV file for easy analysis.

## Prerequisites
Before running the program, make sure you have the required Python libraries installed. You can install them using pip:
```
pip install requests
pip install pandas
pip install beautifulsoup4
pip install fake_useragent
```
## Usage
Update the EAN codes in the script for the wines you want to track. The script currently includes six wines, but you can add or remove wines as needed.
```
MAT_ROSE = "5601012011500"
MAT_SPARK = "5601012001310"
BOLOTAS = "5601012004427"
PAPA_FIGOS = "5601012011920"
LANCERS = "5601142192636"
ESPORAO = "5601989981820"
```
Run python *scraping.py*   

The program will scrape data from the three online stores for each wine and save the results to a CSV file named "data_all.csv" in the same directory.
The program will also print the collected data to the console.

## Data Columns
The program collects the following information for each wine:

- Store Name: The name of the online store where the product was found.
- Wine Name: The name of the wine, standardized for consistency.
- Capacity: The capacity of the wine bottle (in milliliters).
- Price: The current price of the wine.
- Discount: Whether the wine is currently on discount ("Yes" or "No").
- Currency: The currency in which the price is listed.
- Date of scraping: The date when the data was collected.
- Location: The location for which the data is collected (in this case, "Portugal").
