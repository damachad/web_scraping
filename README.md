# Hackathon Sogrape üçá
In response to the pressing challenge posed to Sogrape's Markets and Distribution teams, this project tackles an exciting opportunity 
to develop an innovative solution for tracking wine prices across various online stores. Our collaborative efforts seek to address the 
specific needs of the wine industry, enhancing the company's market competitiveness and distribution efficiency.

This challenge is multifaceted, encompassing two key dimensions: the Technical Dimension (webscraping) and the Visualization and 
Interaction Dimension (dashboard). 
It requires a range of skills, including web scraping, data management, and interface design. 
Our ultimate goal is to create a comprehensive 
solution that is user-friendly, even for professionals without technical expertise, while also paving the way for the global expansion of this
program to track and harvest data from wine markets worldwide.

For this beta version or minimum viable product (MVP), our task involves tracking data from three prominent **websites**: 
- Continente Online
- Garrafeira Soares
- Supermercado El Corte Ingl√©s   
   
The selected **products** for initial monitoring include:
- Mateus Rose Original
- Mateus Sparkling Rose
- Herdade do Peso Trinca Bolotas Tinto
- Casa Ferreirinha Papa Figos Branco
