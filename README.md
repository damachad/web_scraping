# Hackathon Sogrape üçá

This challenge is multifaceted, encompassing two key dimensions: the Technical Dimension (webscraping) and the Visualization and 
Interaction Dimension (dashboard). It requires a range of skills, including web scraping, data management, and interface design. 
The ultimate goal is to create a comprehensive solution that is user-friendly, even for professionals without technical expertise, while also paving the way for the global expansion of this program to track and harvest data from wine markets worldwide.
